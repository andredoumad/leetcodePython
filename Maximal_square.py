Maximal Square
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:

Input: 

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Output: 4

class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if matrix is None or len(matrix) < 1:
            return 0
        
        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])
        
        dp = [[0]*(cols+1) for _ in range(rows+1)]
        max_side = 0
        
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if matrix[r][c] == '1':
                    dp[r+1][c+1] = min(dp[r][c], dp[r+1][c], dp[r][c+1]) + 1 # Be careful of the indexing since dp grid has additional row and column
                    max_side = max(max_side, dp[r+1][c+1])
                
        return max_side * max_side

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(mn). Single pass - row x col (m=row; n=col)
Space complexity : O(mn). Additional space for dp grid (don't need to worry about additional 1 row and col).

Follow up
Space can be optimized as we don't need to keep the whole dp grid as we progress down the rows in matrix.
